# ‚úÖ Supabase Keep-Alive System - Verification Checklist

## üéâ Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps

**1. Implementation**
- ‚úÖ Vercel cron endpoint created at `/api/cron/keepalive`
- ‚úÖ Local backup script created at `scripts/supabase-keepalive.js`
- ‚úÖ Cron schedule configured in `vercel.json` (every 3 days)
- ‚úÖ Authorization using `CRON_SECRET` environment variable
- ‚úÖ Edge runtime for optimal performance

**2. Configuration**
- ‚úÖ `CRON_SECRET` added to Vercel production environment
- ‚úÖ Supabase credentials verified in `.env.local`
- ‚úÖ Service role key configured for reliable access

**3. Testing**
- ‚úÖ Local script executed successfully
- ‚úÖ API endpoint tested with authorization header
- ‚úÖ Database activity confirmed (0 projects counted)
- ‚úÖ Log file created at `scripts/keepalive.log`

**4. Deployment**
- ‚úÖ Code committed to Git (commit: 95cdd95)
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub main branch
- ‚úÖ Automatically deployed to Vercel
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated in `Development_02.md`

**5. Verification**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Local script test (2025-10-24 09:10:29 UTC)
$ node scripts/supabase-keepalive.js
‚úÖ Database active - 0 projects exist
‚ú® Keep-alive successful!

# ‚úÖ API endpoint test (2025-10-24 09:24:28 UTC)
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer stembot-cron-2025-secure-random-key" \
  https://stembotv1.vercel.app/api/cron/keepalive
{"success":true,"timestamp":"2025-10-24T09:24:28.059Z","projectCount":0}
```

## üìä Current Protection Status

| Metric | Status | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Immediate Protection** | ‚úÖ Active | Database activity generated on 2025-10-24 09:10:29 UTC |
| **Safe Until** | 2025-10-31 | 7 days from last activity |
| **Automated Protection** | ‚úÖ Configured | Cron runs every 3 days starting 2025-10-27 |
| **Authorization** | ‚úÖ Secured | `CRON_SECRET` configured in Vercel |
| **Backup Method** | ‚úÖ Available | Local script ready for manual execution |

## üîç How to Verify Cron Job is Working

### **Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/xiaojunyang0805/stembot-v1/deployments
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Go to "Functions" tab
4. Look for `/api/cron/keepalive` executions
5. Should see successful runs every 3 days

### **Method 2: Vercel Logs**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/xiaojunyang0805/stembot-v1/logs
2. Filter by: `/api/cron/keepalive`
3. Check for recent executions and success messages

### **Method 3: Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/kutpbtpdgptcmrlabekq
2. Navigate to: Editor ‚Üí SQL Editor
3. Run: `SELECT * FROM research_projects LIMIT 1;`
4. Check "Activity" tab for query history (should show activity every 3 days)

### **Method 4: Manual Test**
```bash
# Test endpoint directly
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer stembot-cron-2025-secure-random-key" \
  https://stembotv1.vercel.app/api/cron/keepalive

# Expected response:
# {"success":true,"timestamp":"2025-XX-XXT...","projectCount":N,"message":"Database activity logged successfully"}
```

## üìÖ Expected Timeline

| Date | Event | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| **2025-10-24 09:10** | Initial activity generated | ‚úÖ Completed |
| **2025-10-27 00:00** | First automated cron execution | ‚è≥ Scheduled |
| **2025-10-30 00:00** | Second automated cron execution | ‚è≥ Scheduled |
| **2025-10-31** | Original pause deadline | ‚úÖ Will not occur |
| **Ongoing** | Execution every 3 days forever | ‚úÖ Configured |

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If cron doesn't execute on 2025-10-27:

**Check 1: Verify CRON_SECRET is set**
```bash
# Via Vercel CLI
npx vercel env ls

# Should show: CRON_SECRET (production)
```

**Check 2: Verify cron configuration**
```bash
# Check vercel.json
cat vercel.json

# Should show:
# "crons": [{"path": "/api/cron/keepalive", "schedule": "0 0 */3 * *"}]
```

**Check 3: Manual trigger**
```bash
# Force execution
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer stembot-cron-2025-secure-random-key" \
  https://stembotv1.vercel.app/api/cron/keepalive
```

**Fallback: Run local script**
```bash
node scripts/supabase-keepalive.js
```
