# 🚀 Quick Start: Automated Migration Execution

## For Future Claude Code Sessions

When you need to execute a Supabase migration automatically:

### ⚡ Quick Command

```bash
# 1. Start dev server (if not running)
npm run dev

# 2. Execute migration
node scripts/execute-migration.js supabase/migrations/[filename].sql
```

That's it! ✅

## 📝 Full Workflow Example

```bash
# Step 1: Create migration file
# File: supabase/migrations/20251004_add_new_feature.sql

# Step 2: Test dry-run first (safe, no changes)
node scripts/execute-migration.js --dry-run supabase/migrations/20251004_add_new_feature.sql

# Step 3: Execute for real
node scripts/execute-migration.js supabase/migrations/20251004_add_new_feature.sql

# Step 4: Verify it worked
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/test-migration
```
