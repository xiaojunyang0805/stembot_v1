# WP3-4.2: Polish & Launch Preparation

## Status: Ready to Begin
**Date:** October 1, 2025

---

## Pre-Launch Issues Resolved ✅

### Critical Authentication & RLS Issues (Fixed during WP3-4.1)

#### Issue 1: Custom JWT Authentication Not Recognized
**Problem:** Application uses two auth systems - custom JWT (login page) and Supabase Auth (database operations)
**Impact:** Custom auth users could login but couldn't create/view projects
**Solution:** Created API routes with service role key to bypass RLS
- Commit `39b2b90`: Fixed project creation
- Commit `b5aa0d6`: Fixed project viewing
- Commit `c17e802`: Fixed dashboard listing

**Result:** Custom JWT auth users now have full feature parity with Google OAuth users

#### Issue 2: Row-Level Security (RLS) Blocking Database Operations
**Problem:** Supabase RLS policies only recognized `auth.uid()` from Supabase Auth, blocking custom JWT users
**Error:** "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'projects'"
**Solution:**
- Created `/api/projects/create` endpoint with service role key
- Routes all custom auth database operations through API
- Maintains security via JWT verification

**API Endpoints Created:**
```
POST /api/projects/create - Create new project
GET  /api/projects/create?id=X - Get specific project
GET  /api/projects/create - Get all user projects
```

---

### 2. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

#### Current Performance Baseline
From WP3-4.1 Testing Plan:
- Search term generation: Target <5s
- PDF processing: Target <30s per file
- Credibility assessment: Target <10s per source
- Gap analysis: Target <15s for 5-10 sources

#### Optimization Tasks

**Caching Strategy:**
- [ ] Cache search term generation results (24 hour TTL)
- [ ] Store credibility scores permanently in database
- [ ] Memoize gap analysis unless source count changes
- [ ] Optimize Pinecone vector queries (batch retrieval)

**Background Processing:**
- [ ] Make credibility checks asynchronous (non-blocking)
- [ ] Run gap analysis in background worker
- [ ] Update UI progressively as results stream in
- [ ] Show partial results while processing continues

**Database Optimization:**
- [ ] Add indexes on frequently queried fields:
  - `sources.project_id`
  - `sources.created_at`
  - `projects.user_id`
- [ ] Batch source saves (upload multiple files at once)
- [ ] Review Supabase RLS policies for efficiency
- [ ] Monitor slow query log

**Code Splitting:**
- [ ] Lazy load gap analysis components
- [ ] Dynamic import for PDF processing libraries
- [ ] Split vendor bundles for faster initial load

### 3. ACCESSIBILITY (WCAG AA Compliance)

**Keyboard Navigation:**
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements
- [ ] Escape key closes modals/dialogs
- [ ] Arrow keys navigate source list
- [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons

**Screen Reader Support:**
- [ ] ARIA labels for all icon-only buttons
- [ ] Announce dynamic content changes
- [ ] Descriptive link text (not "click here")
- [ ] Skip navigation links

**Visual Accessibility:**
- [ ] Color contrast ratio ≥4.5:1 for text
- [ ] Don't rely on color alone for meaning
- [ ] Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- [ ] Alt text for all informational images

**Other:**
- [ ] Resizable text up to 200% without breaking layout
- [ ] Form labels properly associated
- [ ] Error messages programmatically linked to fields
