### Data Flow
1. **User arrives** → Load existing methodology or show loading
2. **AI recommendation** → Generate based on research question (2-4s)
3. **User accepts** → Save methodology type, show design form
4. **User fills form** → Auto-save each section (variables, participants, procedure)
5. **Critical check** → Validate on procedure completion (<1s)
6. **Display results** → Color-coded feedback with fixes
7. **Continue** → Methodology ready for data collection

### Error Handling Strategy
```
AI Recommendation Fails
  ├─ Retry #1 (1s delay)
  ├─ Retry #2 (2s delay)
  ├─ Retry #3 (4s delay)
  └─ Show ErrorDisplay
       ├─ "Try Again" button
       └─ "Generic Guidelines" fallback

Save Operation Fails
  ├─ Save to LocalStorage (backup)
  ├─ Retry #1 (1s delay)
  ├─ Retry #2 (2s delay)
  ├─ Retry #3 (4s delay)
  └─ Show SaveErrorDisplay
       └─ "Retry Save Now" button
```
