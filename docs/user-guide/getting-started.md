## What is StemBot?

**StemBot is your personal AI research mentor** that guides you through every step of the research process - from forming a question to writing your final paper.

### Who is it for?
- 🎓 **High school students** starting their first science fair project
- 🔬 **College students** learning to do research
- 👨‍🔬 **Novice researchers** who need structured guidance
- 📖 **Anyone** curious about scientific research

### What makes it special?
Unlike other research tools that overwhelm you with 100+ sources, StemBot:
- ✅ **Guides you step-by-step** (like having a research advisor 24/7)
- ✅ **Curates quality sources** (3-10 carefully selected papers, not 100+)
- ✅ **Explains quality** (tells you WHY a source is trustworthy)
- ✅ **Finds research gaps** (shows you what hasn't been studied yet)
- ✅ **Remembers context** (your AI mentor knows your entire research journey)

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up (1 minute)
1. Go to **[https://stembotv1.vercel.app](https://stembotv1.vercel.app)**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** or **"Continue with Google"**
3. Enter your email and create a password

**That's it!** You're ready to start researching.

---

### Step 2: Create Your First Project (2 minutes)

**Example: Let's research how coffee affects memory**

1. On the dashboard, click **"➕ Start New Research Project"**

2. **Enter your research idea** (just a rough idea is fine!):
   ```
   Does drinking coffee improve memory?
   ```

3. **Select your subject:**
   - Choose: `Psychology` or `Biology` (coffee affects the brain and body)

4. **Click "Create Project"**

**Done!** StemBot now has your research idea and will help you develop it.

---

### Step 3: Develop Your Research Question (2 minutes)

Your project opens in the **Workspace** (chat interface):

**StemBot asks:** *"I see you're interested in coffee and memory. Let's make this more specific. What aspect interests you most?"*

**You respond:**
```
I want to know if coffee helps college students remember what they study
```

**StemBot helps you refine:**
```
Great! Here's a focused research question:

"Does caffeine consumption improve short-term memory retention
in college students during exam preparation?"

This is:
✅ Specific (short-term memory, not all memory)
✅ Measurable (you can test this)
✅ Relevant (college students, exam context)

Would you like to use this question, or refine it further?
```

**You respond:** `Yes, let's use this!`

**Progress Update:** Your question stage advances to **"Emerging"** (50% progress) 🎉

## Creating Your First Project

### Example Walkthrough: "Plant Growth Under Different Light Colors"

Let's walk through a complete beginner project step-by-step.

---

#### **Phase 1: Question Formation** (Week 1)

**Starting Point:** "I want to study plants and light"

**StemBot Conversation:**

| Your Message | StemBot Response |
|--------------|------------------|
| "I want to study plants and light" | "Interesting topic! Are you curious about how light affects plant growth, photosynthesis, or maybe plant health?" |
| "How light affects growth" | "Great! Let's narrow it down. What type of plants? What aspect of growth?" |
| "Tomato plants, how tall they grow" | "Perfect! And what about the light - natural vs artificial? Different colors?" |
| "Different colors of LED lights" | "Excellent! Here's your research question:<br><br>**'How do different LED light colors (red, blue, white) affect the height growth of tomato seedlings over 4 weeks?'**<br><br>This is specific, measurable, and doable in a school setting!" |

**Result:** ✅ Research-Ready Question (100% progress)

---

#### **Phase 2: Literature Review** (Week 2-3)

Now click **"📚 Literature Review"** in the navigation menu.

**What You'll See:**

1. **🔍 Search Strategy (Auto-Generated)**
   ```
   Primary Search Terms:
   LED light color AND tomato growth AND plant height

   Recommended Databases:
   • PubMed (plant biology research)
   • Science Direct (agricultural studies)
   • Google Scholar (broad coverage)
   ```

2. **📚 Demo Sources (3 examples to learn from)**

   **Source 1: High Quality 🟢**
   - **Title:** "LED Light Spectra Effects on Tomato Seedling Development"
   - **Published:** Nature Plants, 2024
   - **Why it's good:** Major journal, recent, large sample (200 plants)
   - **Key Finding:** Red light increases stem elongation by 35%

   **Source 2: Moderate Quality 🟡**
   - **Title:** "Comparing LED Colors for Indoor Tomato Cultivation"
   - **Published:** Journal of Horticultural Science, 2023
   - **Why it's moderate:** Good methodology, smaller sample (50 plants)
   - **Key Finding:** Blue light promotes compact growth

   **Source 3: Low Quality 🔴**
   - **Title:** "My LED Tomato Experiment"
   - **Published:** Student Science Blog, 2020
   - **Why it's low:** No peer review, small sample (5 plants), old data
   - **Use case:** Background info only, not for main evidence

3. **💡 Gap Analysis (What's Missing)**

   After reviewing 3 sources, StemBot finds gaps:

   **Gap #1 (High Priority - 75/100):**
   ```
   "Effect of LED light combinations on tomato seedling growth"

   Why this gap exists:
   - Current studies test single colors (red OR blue)
   - Real-world LED systems combine colors
   - No research on optimal red+blue ratios

   Your opportunity:
   Test mixed LED colors (e.g., 70% red + 30% blue) to find
   the best combination for maximum tomato growth!
   ```

**Action:** Click **"🤍 Save"** on 1-2 high-quality sources. Upload your own PDFs using **"Upload Paper"**.

---

#### **Phase 3: Research Design** (Week 4)

Click **"🔬 Methodology"** to design your experiment.

**StemBot Guides You:**

```
Based on your literature review, here's a research design:

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP:
• 4 groups of tomato seedlings (10 plants each)
  - Group 1: Red LED only
  - Group 2: Blue LED only
  - Group 3: White LED (control)
  - Group 4: Mixed (70% red + 30% blue) - YOUR GAP!

• Measure plant height weekly for 4 weeks
• Keep all other factors constant (water, soil, temperature)

MATERIALS NEEDED:
• 40 tomato seedlings (same variety)
• 4 LED light strips (red, blue, white, programmable)
• Rulers, notebook for measurements
• Timer for consistent light exposure (12 hours/day)

Would you like help creating a data collection table?
```

---

#### **Phase 4: Writing & Documentation** (Week 5-6)

Click **"✍️ Writing and Docs"** to draft your research paper.

**StemBot Provides Templates:**

**Abstract Template:**
```
This study investigated [your research question].
We hypothesized that [your prediction based on literature].
[Brief method: 40 tomato seedlings, 4 LED conditions, 4 weeks].
Results showed that [key finding].
This suggests [interpretation].
```

**Introduction Template (with citations):**
```
Plant growth is influenced by light quality (Zhang et al., 2024).
Previous research found that red light increases stem elongation
by 35% (Source 1 from your literature review).

However, no studies have examined mixed LED colors (Gap #1).
This study addresses this gap by testing...
```

**StemBot Auto-Inserts:**
- ✅ Citations from your saved sources
- ✅ Key findings from your literature review
- ✅ Gap analysis as research justification
- ✅ Methodology details from research design phase

      longitudinal design (2 years), controls for confounders
      → Highly reliable for your research
   ```
3. Click **"🔍 Gap Analysis"**
4. Review identified gaps:
   ```
   Gap #1 (80/100): Effect of sleep consistency vs. duration
   Current research focuses on hours slept, but sleep
   schedule regularity may matter more for academic performance.
   ```

**Time:** 5 hours (2.5 hours/week)

---

#### **Week 4: Methodology**

**Design Study (with StemBot guidance)**
1. Click **"🔬 Methodology"**

   • GPA: Self-reported or institutional data

   Analysis:
   • Calculate average sleep duration per student
   • Correlate with GPA using spreadsheet software
   ```

3. StemBot creates data collection template:
   ```
   Student ID | Night 1 Sleep | Night 2 Sleep | ... | GPA
   001        | 7.5 hrs       | 6.0 hrs       | ... | 3.4
