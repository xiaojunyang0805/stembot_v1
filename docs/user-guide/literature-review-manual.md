## Understanding Source Quality

### The Traffic Light System 🚦

StemBot uses a simple color-coded system to show source quality:

#### 🟢 **High Quality (85-100 points)**
**What it means:** Trust these sources fully for your main arguments

**Characteristics:**
- Published in top-tier journals (Nature, Science, Cell, JACS)
- Recent publication (last 3 years)
- Large sample size or comprehensive study
- Rigorous methodology with controls

**Example:**
```
🟢 High Quality
"Buffer Capacity and pH Stability in Biological Systems"
Journal of the American Chemical Society • 2024 • IF: 16.4

✅ Why Trust This:
"Published in JACS, one of the most prestigious chemistry
journals. Very recent (2024) and uses rigorous experimental
methods. Findings are highly reliable."
```

**How to Use:** Cite these in your main findings and methodology.

---

#### 🟡 **Moderate Quality (60-84 points)**
**What it means:** Good supporting evidence, but has some limitations

**Characteristics:**
- Published in respected journals (IF: 2-10)
- Good methodology but smaller scope
- May be 3-7 years old
- Single institution or limited geography

**Example:**
```
🟡 Moderate Quality
"Thermodynamic Properties of Laboratory Buffer Solutions"
Analytical Chemistry • 2023 • IF: 6.8

⚠️ Good But Limited:
"Sound methodology and recent publication. However,
narrower scope than top-tier studies. Use as supporting
evidence alongside higher-impact sources."
```

**How to Use:** Use for supporting arguments and background information.

---

#### 🔴 **Low Quality (0-59 points)**
**What it means:** Use only for background context, not main evidence

**Characteristics:**
- Case studies (n=1-5 subjects)
- Surveys without experimental controls
- Older research (8+ years)
- Low-impact journals (IF: <2)
- Preprints (not peer-reviewed)

**Example:**
```
🔴 Low Quality
"pH Maintenance in Cell Culture: A Practical Guide"
Lab Techniques Quarterly • 2021 • IF: 1.8

⚠️ Use Carefully:
"Practical guide rather than rigorous research. Published
in lower-impact journal. Use for background understanding
only, not as primary evidence."
```

**How to Use:** Background reading and context only. Always pair with higher-quality sources.

---

### Understanding the Quality Explanation

Each source includes a **"🎓 Research Quality Explained"** section in plain language:

**What StemBot Tells You:**
1. **Why this quality level?** (journal prestige, recency, sample size)
2. **What are the strengths?** (large sample, good controls, recent)
3. **What are the limitations?** (small scope, older, case study)
4. **How should you use it?** (main evidence vs. background)

**Example Explanation:**
```
This source has moderate credibility because it analyzes
data over a long period (10 years) and includes many
prescriptions, which makes the patterns reliable. However,
it's published in a lower-impact journal and only looks at
one healthcare system, so the findings might not apply
everywhere. It's useful supporting evidence but pair it
with higher-quality sources.
```

**No jargon, just clear guidance!**

---

### Quality Factors Explained

#### Impact Factor (IF)
**What it is:** Average number of citations per paper in that journal
**Why it matters:** Higher IF = more influential research

| Impact Factor | Quality | Examples |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| IF: 10+ | Top-tier | Nature, Science, Cell |
| IF: 5-10 | Excellent | PLOS Biology, Neuron |
| IF: 2-5 | Good | Many specialized journals |
| IF: <2 | Lower-tier | Emerging or niche journals |

#### Sample Size
**What it is:** Number of subjects/samples in the study
**Why it matters:** Larger = more reliable, generalizable

| Sample Size | Reliability | Use For |
|-------------|------------|---------|
| n > 1000 | Very high | Main evidence |
| n = 100-1000 | High | Strong support |
| n = 30-100 | Moderate | Supporting evidence |
| n < 30 | Low | Background only |

#### Publication Year
**What it is:** How recent the research is
**Why it matters:** Science advances quickly

| Age | Quality | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| 0-3 years | Excellent | Current research |
| 3-7 years | Good | Still relevant |
| 7-15 years | Moderate | May be outdated |
| 15+ years | Low | Check if superseded |

#### Study Type (Strongest to Weakest)
1. **Meta-Analysis/Systematic Review** - Combines many studies
2. **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)** - Gold standard for experiments
3. **Cohort/Longitudinal Study** - Tracks changes over time
4. **Cross-Sectional Study** - Snapshot in time (can't prove causation)
5. **Case Study/Survey** - Limited generalizability

## Gap Analysis - Finding Your Research Opportunity

### What is Gap Analysis?

Gap analysis is StemBot's **AI-powered feature** that identifies:
- 🔍 What's missing in existing research
- 🎯 Opportunities for YOUR research to contribute
- 💡 Suggestions for how to fill those gaps

**When it activates:** Automatically when you have **3+ sources**

---

### How Gap Analysis Works

#### Step 1: Collect Sources
Add at least 3 sources to your literature collection.

#### Step 2: AI Analysis (10-15 seconds)
StemBot's AI:
- Reads all your sources
- Compares them to your research question
- Identifies patterns and missing pieces
- Generates research opportunities

You'll see: **"🔄 Analyzing literature for gaps and opportunities..."**

#### Step 3: View Results

```
🧠 Literature Gap Analysis
3 sources analyzed

📊 Overall Assessment: Low Confidence
"Based on analysis of 3 sources, your literature collection
shows initial patterns, though additional sources would
strengthen the analysis."
```

**Confidence Levels:**
- **Low Confidence** (3-5 sources) - Initial patterns
- **Moderate Confidence** (6-10 sources) - Clear trends
- **High Confidence** (10+ sources) - Comprehensive analysis

---

### Understanding Identified Gaps

#### Example Gap 1:
```
⚠️ Moderate Priority (Score: 63/100)

Impact of Buffer Composition on pH Stability in Biological Systems

📝 What's Missing:
"Investigate how different buffer compositions affect pH
stability in biological samples (like blood or cell culture)
under varying temperature conditions."

💡 Why This Matters:
"This gap represents an opportunity to contribute new knowledge"

🎯 How to Fill It:
"Further investigation needed"
```

#### Example Gap 2:
```
⚠️ Low Priority (Score: 45/100)

Influence of Ionic Strength on Buffer Performance

📝 What's Missing:
"Examine how variations in ionic strength affect the pH
stability of different buffer compositions when subjected
to temperature changes."
```

---

### How to Use Gap Analysis Results

#### 1. **Choose Your Research Focus**
Pick the **highest priority gap** that:
- ✅ Interests you
- ✅ Matches your resources (time, equipment, funding)
- ✅ Is feasible for your project scope

#### 2. **Refine Your Research Question**
Use the gap to sharpen your question:

**Before:**
"How do different buffer compositions affect pH stability?"

**After (more focused):**
"How do phosphate vs. acetate buffer compositions affect pH stability in blood samples under temperature variations from 20-40°C?"

#### 3. **Design Your Methodology**
The gap tells you what to test:
- **Variables to manipulate:** Buffer types, temperatures
- **What to measure:** pH stability over time
- **Conditions:** Biological systems (blood samples)

#### 4. **Justify Your Research**
In your research proposal, you can say:

> "Current literature shows extensive research on buffer chemistry, but there's a significant gap regarding buffer performance in biological systems under thermal stress. This research fills that gap by comparing phosphate and acetate buffers in blood samples across temperature ranges..."

**This makes your research sound important!**

---

### Gap Analysis Pro Tips

**💡 Add More Sources for Better Analysis**
3 sources = basic patterns
10+ sources = deep insights

**💡 Look for "Moderate to High Priority" Gaps**
These are the sweet spot - impactful but achievable.

**💡 Check the Score**
- 80-100: Major research opportunity (might be too big for one project)
- 60-80: Good opportunity (right size for thesis/dissertation)
- 40-60: Minor gap (good for course projects)
- 0-40: Already well-researched (avoid)

**💡 Use Multiple Gaps**
Address 2-3 related gaps to make your research more comprehensive.
