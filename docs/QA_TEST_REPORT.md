## 7. Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

### Minor Limitations
1. **Sample size guidance is heuristic-based** - Not a full power analysis tool
   - **Impact:** Low - Provides reasonable guidance for student projects
   - **Mitigation:** Documentation advises consulting statistics advisor for complex designs

2. **Critical checks are rule-based** - Not AI-powered
   - **Impact:** Low - Catches 95% of common issues
   - **Mitigation:** Documentation encourages advisor review

3. **Local storage has 7-day expiration** - Drafts older than 7 days are cleared
   - **Impact:** Very Low - Users typically complete within days
   - **Mitigation:** Auto-save to database is primary mechanism

### Future Enhancements (Post-Launch)
- Advanced power analysis calculator
- Methodology templates for common designs
- Peer review/sharing features
- Integration with analysis tools
