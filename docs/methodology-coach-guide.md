# Methodology Coach User Guide

Welcome to the Methodology Coach! This tool helps you design a research methodology that's perfect for your project.

## üéØ What is the Methodology Coach?

The Methodology Coach is your AI-powered assistant that:
- Recommends the best research method for your question
- Helps you define your variables
- Guides you through study design
- Checks for common issues before you start

## üìñ How to Use the Methodology Coach

### Step 1: Get Your Recommendation

When you open the Methodology page, our AI will automatically:
1. Read your research question
2. Review your literature (if you've done a lit review)
3. Recommend the most suitable methodology

**What you'll see:**
- **Method Name**: e.g., "Experimental Study", "Survey Research"
- **Rationale**: Why this method works for your question
- **Key Steps**: What you need to do
- **Time Estimate**: How long it might take
- **Alternative**: Another option to consider

**What to do:**
- Click **"Accept This Methodology"** if it looks good
- Click **"Request Different Method"** if you want another suggestion
- Read the **Alternative** if you're not sure

---

### Step 2: Fill in Your Study Design

Once you accept a methodology, you'll fill in:

#### **Independent Variables** (What you're changing/manipulating)
- Example: "Amount of sleep" (4 hours vs. 8 hours)
- Add a clear description of how you'll measure it

#### **Dependent Variables** (What you're measuring as an outcome)
- Example: "Memory test scores" (number of words recalled)
- Explain how you'll collect this data

#### **Control Variables** (What you're keeping the same)
- Example: "Age of participants" (all 18-25 years old)
- List anything that might affect your results

#### **Participants**
- **Who**: Describe your target population (e.g., "University students aged 18-22")
- **How Many**: Sample size (our coach will suggest if you need help!)
- **How to Recruit**: Where/how you'll find participants (e.g., "Psychology course sign-ups")

#### **Procedure**
Write step-by-step what will happen:
1. Participant arrives and signs consent
2. Complete pre-test questionnaire
3. Receive intervention/treatment
4. Complete post-test
5. Debrief and thank participant

**üí° Tip:** Be specific! Imagine someone else has to run your study using only your instructions.

### Step 3: Check for Issues

Click **"Check My Design"** to get AI feedback on:
- ‚úÖ **Sample Size**: Is it big enough for your analysis?
- ‚úÖ **Ethics**: Have you considered participant safety and consent?
- ‚úÖ **Clarity**: Are your procedures clear and detailed?
- ‚úÖ **Feasibility**: Can you actually do this with your time/resources?

The coach will give you:
- **Green ‚úÖ**: Looks good!
- **Yellow ‚ö†Ô∏è**: Minor issues to consider
- **Red ‚ùå**: Critical problems to fix before continuing

### Step 4: What to Do Next

After completing your methodology:

1. **Save Your Work**: Everything saves automatically, but check for the "Saved" indicator
2. **Consult Your Advisor**: Show them your methodology for feedback
3. **Check Ethics Requirements**: Does your university need ethics approval? (See FAQ below)
4. **Move to Data Collection**: Once approved, you're ready to collect data!

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### **Can I change my methodology later?**
‚úÖ **Yes!** You can return to this page and click "Request Different Method" or edit your variables at any time. However, once you start collecting data, changing your methodology means starting over with data collection.

### **Do I need ethics approval?**
üèõÔ∏è **It depends.** Most universities require ethics approval (also called IRB approval) if you're working with:
- Human participants
- Animal subjects
- Sensitive data (health info, minors, etc.)

**What to do:** Check with your research advisor or your university's ethics committee. They'll guide you through the approval process.

### **Is my sample size big enough?**
üìä **Our coach provides guidance!** When you click "Check My Design", you'll get feedback on whether your sample size is appropriate for your study type.

**General rules:**
- **Experimental studies**: 20-30 participants per group minimum
- **Surveys**: 100+ for generalizable results
- **Qualitative studies**: 10-20 for in-depth interviews

**But:** Your specific needs depend on your analysis method. Consult with a statistics advisor if you're unsure!

### **What if the AI recommendation doesn't make sense?**
üîÑ **Try these steps:**
1. Click "Request Different Method" to get another suggestion
2. Check if your research question is clear and specific
3. Review if you've completed your literature review
4. Use the "Show Generic Guidelines" button for basic methodology principles
5. Consult your research advisor

### **Can I skip some sections?**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Not recommended.** All sections (variables, participants, procedure) are important for a complete methodology. However, you can save your progress and come back to finish later.

### **What if I'm doing a qualitative study?**
üìù **The coach supports qualitative research too!** You'll see sections for:
- **Interview/Observation Protocol** instead of variables
- **Participant Selection Criteria** (purposive sampling, etc.)
- **Data Analysis Plan** (coding, themes, etc.)

### **How do I know if my methodology is "research-ready"?**
‚úÖ **Your methodology is ready when:**
1. All sections are filled out completely
2. The "Check My Design" feedback shows mostly green checkmarks
3. Your advisor has reviewed and approved it
4. You have (or are applying for) ethics approval if needed

## üíæ Saving and Syncing

### **Automatic Saves**
- Your work saves automatically every time you complete a section
- Look for the "Saved" indicator in the top right

### **What if saving fails?**
- **Don't worry!** Your work is saved locally on your device
- We'll automatically retry syncing to the server
- You'll see a yellow banner if there's a sync issue
- Click "Retry Save Now" to manually try again

### **Working Offline**
- You can work on your methodology offline
- Changes will sync when you reconnect to the internet
