- Find failed webhook event
- Status: "Failed" with retry count
```

#### 6.2 Check Retry Mechanism
```
Stripe Automatic Retries:
- Stripe retries failed webhooks automatically
- Retry schedule:

Test:
1. Webhook fails to deliver
2. Admin notices subscription not updated
3. Admin calls manual sync API:

POST /api/admin/sync-subscription
{
  "userId": "{user_id}"
}

Expected:
- API fetches subscription from Stripe
- Updates local database
- Returns sync status

Verify:
- Database matches Stripe data after sync
```

#### 6.4 Test Idempotency (Same Webhook Twice)
```
Scenario: Webhook delivered twice due to network issue

Test:
1. Process webhook: subscription.updated (tier change)
2. Replay same webhook with identical payload
3. Check database

Expected:
‚úÖ Idempotency key prevents duplicate processing
‚úÖ Database unchanged on second webhook
‚úÖ No duplicate payment records
‚úÖ No duplicate emails sent

Code Check:
// In webhook handler
const idempotencyKey = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
// Check if already processed
const existing = await db.processedWebhooks.findOne({ idempotencyKey });
if (existing) {
  return res.status(200).send('Already processed');
}
```

### **‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Webhook failures logged in Stripe Dashboard
- [ ] Automatic retry mechanism works
- [ ] Retries succeed after endpoint fixed
- [ ] Manual sync API available for admins
- [ ] Manual sync updates database correctly
- [ ] Idempotency prevents duplicate processing

## üß™ TEST SCENARIO 7: Edge Cases

### **Objective:** Test boundary conditions and error handling

### **Test Steps:**

#### 7.1 User with No Subscription Record
```
Scenario: New user, no subscription created yet

Setup:
DELETE FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = '{user_id}';

Action: User logs in, tries to create project

Expected:
‚úÖ System defaults to free tier
‚úÖ Project creation enforces free tier limits (1 project)
‚úÖ No errors thrown
‚úÖ Subscription record auto-created on first action

Code Check:
// In getUserSubscription()
if (!subscription) {
  return { tier: 'free', status: 'active' };
}
```

#### 7.2 Deleted Stripe Customer
```
Scenario: User's Stripe customer deleted (refund, fraud, etc.)

Setup:

2. Database still has stripe_customer_id

Action: User tries to access billing settings

Expected:
‚úÖ Graceful fallback to free tier
‚úÖ Error logged (but not shown to user)
‚úÖ Prompt to re-subscribe
‚úÖ No crash

Error Handling:
try {
  const customer = await stripe.customers.retrieve(customerId);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'resource_missing') {
    // Customer deleted, downgrade to free
    await downgradeToFree(userId);
  }
}
```

#### 7.3 Concurrent Requests to Increment Usage
```
Scenario: User makes 5 AI requests simultaneously

Test:
const promises = Array(5).fill(null).map(() =>
  fetch('/api/ai/chat', { method: 'POST', body: {...} })
);
await Promise.all(promises);

Expected:
‚úÖ All 5 requests processed
‚úÖ ai_interactions_count increments by exactly 5 (no race condition)
‚úÖ No duplicate increments
‚úÖ No lost increments

Database Function (Atomic Increment):
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_ai_usage(
  p_user_id UUID,
  p_month TEXT
)
RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
  -- Atomic increment
  UPDATE usage_tracking
  SET ai_interactions_count = ai_interactions_count + 1
  WHERE user_id = p_user_id AND month = p_month
  RETURNING ai_interactions_count;
$$ LANGUAGE sql;
```

#### 7.4 Usage Tracking Month Rollover
```
Scenario: Month changes from October to November

Test Date: Oct 31, 23:59 ‚Üí Nov 1, 00:01

Setup:
- User has 29/30 AI interactions in October
- User makes request at 23:59 on Oct 31 (interaction #30)
- User makes request at 00:01 on Nov 1 (should be #1 for November)

Expected:
‚úÖ October usage: ai_interactions_count = 30
‚úÖ November usage: new row created with ai_interactions_count = 1
‚úÖ Limits reset correctly
‚úÖ No carryover from October

Database Check:
SELECT month, ai_interactions_count
FROM usage_tracking
WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'
ORDER BY month DESC
LIMIT 2;

Expected:
| month   | ai_interactions_count |
|---------|-----------------------|
| 2025-11 | 1                     |
| 2025-10 | 30                    |
```

#### 7.5 Timezone Handling for Subscription Periods
```
Scenario: User in different timezone, subscription period ends

User Timezone: UTC+8 (Beijing)
Server Timezone: UTC+0
Subscription Period End: 2025-11-01 00:00:00 UTC

Test:
1. Nov 1, 08:00 in Beijing = Nov 1, 00:00 UTC
2. User tries to use paid features at 07:59 Beijing time

Expected:
‚úÖ Features work until 08:00 Beijing time
‚úÖ At 08:00 Beijing time, features restricted
‚úÖ All times consistent with UTC
‚úÖ No early or late cutoff

Code Check:
const periodEnd = new Date(subscription.current_period_end);
const now = new Date();
const isActive = now < periodEnd; // Both in UTC
```

### **‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Missing subscription defaults to free tier gracefully
- [ ] Deleted Stripe customer handled without crash
- [ ] Concurrent usage increments are atomic (no race conditions)
- [ ] Month rollover resets usage correctly
- [ ] Timezone handling consistent across all users
- [ ] No off-by-one errors in limit checks
- [ ] All edge cases logged for monitoring

### **üìù Additional Edge Cases:**

---

## üß™ TEST SCENARIO 8: Usage Limit Edge Cases

### **Objective:** Test boundary conditions for usage limits

### **Test Steps:**

#### 8.1 Exactly at Limit (30/30) - Allow or Block?
```
Setup:
UPDATE usage_tracking
SET ai_interactions_count = 30
WHERE user_id = '{user_id}' AND month = '2025-10';

Action: User makes 1 AI request

Code Decision:
Option A: allowed = usage < limit   // 30 < 30 = false ‚Üí BLOCK
Option B: allowed = usage <= limit  // 30 <= 30 = true ‚Üí ALLOW

Current Implementation Check:
// src/lib/stripe/subscriptionHelpers.ts:399
const allowed = usage.ai_interactions_count < usage.ai_interactions_limit;

Expected with Current Code:
‚ùå BLOCKED at 30/30
‚úÖ Last allowed interaction is 29/30

Test:
1. Set count to 29
2. Make request ‚Üí Should succeed (30/30)
3. Make request ‚Üí Should block (30/30)
```

#### 8.2 Usage Increment Fails - Retry or Fail Silently?
```
Scenario: Database error during usage increment

Test:
1. Disconnect database temporarily
2. User makes AI request
3. AI response succeeds but usage increment fails

Current Implementation:
try {
  const response = await callAI(prompt);
  await incrementAIUsage(userId); // Fails here
  return response;
} catch (error) {
  // What happens?
}

Options:
Option A: Retry increment 3 times, then fail silently (log error)
Option B: Rollback AI response, show error to user
Option C: Queue increment for later processing

Expected Behavior:
‚úÖ User gets AI response (they paid for it)
‚úÖ Increment queued for retry
‚ö†Ô∏è  Monitor shows missed increment
‚úÖ Next request includes retry of previous increment
```

#### 8.3 Subscription Changes Mid-Month - Prorate Usage Limits?
```
Scenario: User on free tier (30/30 limit reached) upgrades to Student Pro mid-month

Current State:
- Month: 2025-10
- ai_interactions_count: 30
- tier: free (limit: 30)

Action: User upgrades to Student Pro

Options:
Option A: Unlimited immediately (30 already used doesn't matter)
Option B: Prorate: grant extra 15 for remaining half month
Option C: Wait until next month for unlimited

Recommended Implementation:
‚úÖ Option A: Unlimited immediately (best UX)

Test:
1. Reach free limit (30/30)
2. Upgrade to Student Pro
3. Immediately make AI request

Expected:
‚úÖ Request succeeds
‚úÖ No limit message
‚úÖ Usage UI shows "Unlimited" or "‚àû"
‚úÖ ai_interactions_count continues incrementing (for stats) but no limit enforced
```

### **‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Limit enforcement uses strict inequality (< not <=)
- [ ] User gets 30 interactions on free tier (0-29)
- [ ] Increment failures handled gracefully
- [ ] Failed increments queued for retry
- [ ] Mid-month upgrade grants immediate full access
- [ ] No partial month prorating complexity
- [ ] All boundary conditions tested

### **üìù Additional Edge Cases:**
- User at 29/30, makes 2 simultaneous requests ‚Üí Only 1 succeeds?
- Downgrade mid-month from unlimited to free (already used 50) ‚Üí Immediately limited or grace period?
- Month rollover while request in flight ‚Üí Which month's quota used?

Action: User tries to upgrade

Expected:
‚úÖ User-friendly error message: "Payment service temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes."
‚úÖ No app crash
‚úÖ Error logged to monitoring system
‚úÖ User can retry after Stripe recovers

Code:
try {
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({...});
} catch (error) {
  if (error.type === 'StripeAPIError') {
    return res.status(503).json({
      error: 'Payment service unavailable',
      retryAfter: 60
    });
  }
}
```

#### E.2 Database Connection Lost During Checkout - Recovery
```
Simulate: Database goes down after Stripe Checkout succeeds but before webhook processes

Sequence:
1. User completes payment ‚úÖ
2. Stripe webhook fires ‚úÖ
3. Webhook tries to update database ‚ùå (connection lost)
4. Webhook retry 1 hour later ‚úÖ

Expected:
‚úÖ User sees loading state in app
‚úÖ Webhook retries automatically
‚úÖ Database updates on retry
‚úÖ User subscription activated (delayed but successful)

Monitoring Alert:
‚ö†Ô∏è  Webhook processing failed due to database error - will retry
```

#### E.3 Webhook Signature Invalid - Reject Safely
```
Attack Scenario: Malicious actor sends fake webhook

Test:
curl -X POST https://stembotv1.vercel.app/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"subscription.updated","data":{"object":{"id":"fake"}}}'

Expected:
‚ùå Request rejected
‚ùå Status 400 Bad Request
‚úÖ Error: "Invalid webhook signature"
‚úÖ No database changes
‚úÖ Security alert logged

Code:
const sig = req.headers['stripe-signature'];
try {
  const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(body, sig, webhookSecret);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('‚ö†Ô∏è  Webhook signature verification failed:', err.message);
  return res.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
}
```

#### E.4 Missing Environment Variables - Clear Error Messages
```
Test: Remove Stripe keys from environment

Action: Restart server

Expected Error Logs:
‚ùå STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is missing from environment variables
‚ùå Stripe initialization failed
üí° Please add it to your .env.local file
üí° See STRIPE_SETUP.md for instructions

Test in UI:
- Navigate to /settings/billing
- Expected: Error banner: "Billing features unavailable. Contact support."
- No sensitive error details exposed to user
```

### **‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Stripe API errors don't crash app
- [ ] User-friendly error messages shown
- [ ] Errors logged to monitoring system
- [ ] Webhook signature validation prevents fake webhooks
- [ ] Database errors trigger automatic retries
- [ ] Missing environment variables caught on startup
- [ ] All errors have clear resolution paths

## üß™ PERFORMANCE TESTS

### **Objective:** Test system under load

### **Test Steps:**

#### P.1 Load Settings Page with Large Payment History
```
Setup: Create 100+ payment records for user

Test:
1. Navigate to /settings/billing
2. Measure page load time
3. Check payment history pagination

Expected:
‚úÖ Page loads in < 3 seconds
‚úÖ Payment history paginated (10-20 per page)
‚úÖ No memory leaks
‚úÖ Smooth scrolling

Performance Metrics:
- Time to First Byte (TTFB): < 500ms
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): < 0.1
```

#### P.2 Multiple Users Upgrading Simultaneously
```
Load Test: 10 concurrent users upgrade at same time

Test Script:
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST https://stembotv1.vercel.app/api/billing/create-checkout &
done
wait

Expected:
‚úÖ All requests succeed
‚úÖ No database deadlocks
‚úÖ No race conditions
‚úÖ All webhooks processed correctly

Monitor:
- Vercel function execution time
- Supabase connection pool usage
- Stripe API rate limits not hit
```

#### P.3 Usage Increment Performance Under Load
```
Load Test: 100 AI requests in 10 seconds

Test:
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST https://stembotv1.vercel.app/api/ai/chat &
  sleep 0.1
done

Expected:
‚úÖ All increments processed
‚úÖ Final count = 100 (no lost increments)
‚úÖ Response time < 2s per request
‚úÖ No database lock timeouts

Database Check:
SELECT ai_interactions_count FROM usage_tracking WHERE user_id = '{user_id}';
Expected: Exactly 100
```

### **‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Billing page loads quickly with large history
- [ ] Pagination works correctly
- [ ] Concurrent checkouts don't cause race conditions
- [ ] Usage increments are atomic and accurate
- [ ] No performance degradation under load
- [ ] Database connection pool sized appropriately

## üß™ SECURITY TESTS

### **Objective:** Verify authorization and security controls

### **Test Steps:**

#### S.1 Attempt to Upgrade Another User's Subscription
```
Attack Scenario: User A tries to upgrade User B's subscription

Test:
POST /api/billing/create-checkout
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {user_a_token}
Body: { "userId": "{user_b_id}", "tier": "student_pro" }

Expected:
‚ùå Request rejected
‚ùå Status 403 Forbidden
‚úÖ Error: "Unauthorized"
‚úÖ User B subscription unchanged

Code Check:
const session = await getServerSession(req);
const userId = session.user.id;
// NEVER trust userId from request body
```

#### S.2 Tamper with Checkout Session Metadata
```
Attack Scenario: Modify Stripe Checkout session metadata

Attempt:
1. Intercept checkout session creation
2. Modify metadata: tier: "free" or price: "0"
3. Complete checkout

Expected:
‚úÖ Stripe validates session server-side
‚úÖ Metadata cannot be tampered (signed by Stripe)
‚úÖ Webhook uses Stripe data as source of truth (not request data)

Webhook Code:
// ALWAYS use Stripe event data, not request body
const subscription = event.data.object;
const tier = subscription.metadata.tier; // From Stripe, not tampered
```

#### S.3 Access Customer Portal Without Subscription
```
Attack Scenario: Free user tries to access portal

Test:
POST /api/billing/portal
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {free_user_token}

Expected:
‚ùå Status 400 Bad Request
‚úÖ Error: "No active subscription"
OR
‚úÖ Redirect to upgrade page

Code:
const subscription = await getUserSubscription(userId);
if (!subscription.stripe_customer_id) {
  return res.status(400).json({ error: 'No active subscription' });
}
```

#### S.4 Direct Database Manipulation - Prevented by RLS
```
Attack Scenario: User tries to modify subscription directly via Supabase client

Test (Client-Side):
const { error } = await supabase
  .from('subscriptions')
  .update({ tier: 'researcher' })
  .eq('user_id', '{own_user_id}');

Expected:
‚ùå Error: "new row violates row-level security policy"
‚úÖ RLS policy blocks unauthorized update
‚úÖ Only server with service role key can update

RLS Policy Check:
-- On subscriptions table
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own subscription"
  ON subscriptions FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Only service role can update subscriptions"
  ON subscriptions FOR UPDATE
  USING (false) -- No client-side updates allowed
  WITH CHECK (false);
```

### **‚úÖ Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can only manage their own subscriptions
- [ ] Checkout session metadata cannot be tampered
- [ ] Webhooks validate Stripe signatures
- [ ] RLS prevents direct subscription modifications
- [ ] All API routes check authentication
- [ ] All API routes validate user ownership
- [ ] Sensitive errors don't leak information

SELECT * FROM payment_history
WHERE user_id = '{user_id}'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Find users with past_due subscriptions
SELECT u.email, s.*
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN users u ON u.id = s.user_id
WHERE s.status = 'past_due';

-- Reset user's usage (testing only!)
UPDATE usage_tracking
SET ai_interactions_count = 0,
    active_projects_count = 0
WHERE user_id = '{user_id}' AND month = '2025-10';
```

### Stripe CLI Commands

```bash
# Listen to webhooks locally
